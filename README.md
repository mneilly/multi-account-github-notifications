This extension adds icons to the Gnome top bar to notify the user when there 
are notifications for their GitHub account. It is derived from the extension 
by Alex Dufournet at https://github.com/alexduf/gnome-github-notifications.

It has not been extensively tested and has some issues with the preferences 
panel that need to be cleaned up. It supports internationalization but no
translations have been put in place. Feel free to submit pull requests to
provide proper translations. :)
